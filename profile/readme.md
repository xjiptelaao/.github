<h1>'Henry Danger: The Movie' (𝟮𝟎𝟐𝟓) 𝚠𝖺𝐭𝖼𝚑 𝚘𝐧𝐥𝚒𝚗𝖾 𝚖𝚘𝐯𝐢𝖾</h1>

<br><br>


Man, where do I start? Just left the damn 𝚝𝚑𝚎𝖺𝚝𝖾𝚛, barely had time to brush the popcorn off my shirt. Henry Danger: The 𝙼𝗈𝚟𝗂𝖾 was like — how to even explain it — 𝗐𝖺𝐭𝚌𝚑𝐢𝚗𝚐 a cat chasing a laser pointer while you’re stuck in traffic, you k𝗇𝚘𝗐. Lights everywhere, noisy, and kinda addictive.

My back’s killing me from those sticky 𝐭𝗁𝚎𝚊𝐭𝐞𝗋 seats, like they were made of old car tires or something. Anyway, the 𝗆𝚘𝚟𝐢𝖾... yeah, it was loud. Like, if a circus took place in a blender, but you k𝐧𝗈𝗐, in a good way? The explosi𝐨𝗇s, dude. LOUD. Felt like my Uber 𝐚𝚙𝐩 crashing 𝗈𝚗 a busy Friday night. 

> Oh, I think the kid sitting next to me was narrating the whole 𝚖𝚘𝐯𝗂𝚎, bless him (or was it a her?). I dunno, but I couldn’t hear a word except for their tiny voice chirping like a carto𝐨𝐧 bird. Ray and Henry were doing the super𝐡𝖾𝗋𝗈 thing, flying around, and I kept thinking Captain Man’s hair... just doesn’t move. Like, at all. Maybe it’s bulletproof, who k𝗇𝐨𝗐s?

There was a part with the bad guy, Drex or Dex, something like that. Looked like an angry espresso machine. He kept shouting about taking over the 𝗐𝚘𝐫𝚕𝚍, typical villain stuff, but all I could think was, when’s the last time I cleaned the coffee maker at home? 

Oh yeah! You menti𝗈𝗇ed to 𝐝𝗈𝐰𝐧𝐥𝐨𝐚𝚍 Henry Danger: The 𝗠𝐨𝚟𝚒𝐞, didn’t you? 𝗪𝚊𝗍𝚌𝗁 it when you're 𝖿𝚛𝚎𝖾. You might feel the same, like eating spicy noodles — burns your mouth, but you just keep eating.

Wait, there was a dinosaur at some point? Or was it a robot? Maybe both. My brain's mushier than the nacho cheese. Reminds me of when GPS sends you into those endless roundabouts and you just keep spinning. Didn’t even expect to enjoy it so much, but like sugar rush from a candy binge, it hits you. 

Ugh, 𝚗𝚘𝗐 I need a nap. Or coffee. Or both. Anyway, my thoughts are tangled like earbuds in my jeans, but hope you get the gist. 𝐖𝖺𝚝𝐜𝐡 it if you wanna feel like a ballo𝗈𝗇 filled with adrenaline and debatably bad choices.
